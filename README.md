# Advent of Code

> [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2017/about) is a series of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill levels. They are self-contained and are just as appropriate for an expert who wants to stay sharp as they are for a beginner who is just learning to code. Each puzzle calls upon different skills and has two parts that build on a theme.

We currently have implementations for languages above:

- [JS](https://github.com/dynamoxteam/advent-of-code/tree/master/2017/js)
- [Rust](https://github.com/dynamoxteam/advent-of-code/tree/master/2017/rust)

Join us sending new language implementations or improvements to the already existent
